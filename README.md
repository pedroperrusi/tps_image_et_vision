In order to install OpenCV 3 and build and run the examples on OSX High Sierra, I followed the following guides:

* https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-on-yosemite-osx-10-10-x/
* https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv/issues/366.

The two main calls were:
```(bash)
brew install opencv3
brew install gflags
brew install glog
```
